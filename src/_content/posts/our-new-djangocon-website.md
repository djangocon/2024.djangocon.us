title: "Our New DjangoCon US 2024 Brand and Website"
---


Fully re-built from the ground up, we are pleased to announce our brand new website and branding for DjangoCon US 2024. Every year we refresh our banding to align with our host city, but this year we decided to go a step further and re-boot our website, optimizing for contributor experience.

Why now? As noted in our [CFP](https://www.defna.org/announcements/2024/01/12/call-for-proposals-for-djangocon-2024-website/), we had been using and re-skinning the same Jekyll build since 2017, and it had become increasingly cumbersome for contributors to make edits and layout changes. We hired [YupGup](https://yupgup.com/) to help us select a new framework, rebuild the front-end markup and CSS, and do a branding refresh. We addressed the following:

- Built in 11ty, a feature-rich static site generator
- TailwindCSS as our baseline for styles
- Made it easier to work on the website locally – no ruby needed!
- Improving the schedule with some UX enhancements.
-  Targeting high 90s Lighthouse scores for v1 website performance
-  Introduced better tools for responsive, optimized images
- Simplified Markdown-based file formats and data.

Alongside the tech stuff, we worked closely with Joni Trythall of [YupGup](https://yupgup.com/) to bring our second Durham edition to life, aptly named "Durham Doodles". Here are Joni's thoughts on our process and direction:

> Each year we've collaborated with the DjangoCon US team, we kick things off with a group conversation followed by some moodboards. These moodboards are great for getting a high-level feel for a direction without investing too much time into drawing out anything overly detailed or specific. I start with some general directions in mind after our call and set out to explore the internet for screenshots to build cohesive pitches. Once a possible direction is selected, a style tile is produced for review with elements that are much more specific to the project. This enables everyone to confidently select a theme to run with.

> While the community is consistently friendly, welcoming, unique, and fun, some new adjectives introduced this year were unexpected, gritty, and artsy. The Cartoon Town theme direction perfectly captures and helps define the spirit of this year's upcoming event, while celebrating the heart of the community itself but also Durham. You’ll find lots of easter eggs from both throughout the design, from a seemingly misplaced crab down to the color names.

> A significant part of this design is, of course, the doodles and characters—some new and some old favorites with a new look. Having this library of illustrations to pull from has proven to be especially valuable for these projects. The group can access all these characters and individual parts to assemble social graphics as needed and swag design really falls into place nicely—like lemur t-shirts! While a site's skeleton can be reused each year, updating these illustrations keeps the experience feeling fresh, energized, and always relevant.
