DjangoCon US is a premier event for the Django community, and it wouldn't be possible without the invaluable contributions of our volunteers. As a co-chair of the Volunteer program, I can attest to the immense impact that our volunteers have on the success of this conference.

## Why Should You Volunteer?
I know you're already busy, but hear me out – volunteering at DjangoCon US is an opportunity you don't want to miss. Here's why:

- **Contribute:** When you volunteer, you help the community to grow and give feedback to Django as a product and ecosystem. This is your opportunity to have a real impact and help the tech and the people you love.

- **Level up:** Volunteering at a conference like this is a wonderful experience where you can gain a lot of knowledge and new skills. You will acquire a range of new skills: from organizing events, rallying the troops, and problem-solving. Nah, these are the types of skill sets that do you good in real life and even professionally.

- **Get Networking:** Volunteers will be working alongside Django engineers from around the globe, including some of the most experienced and passionate Django contributors and consultants—such a valuable chance to network, collaborate on projects, and build lasting friendships within the community.

## What Can You Expect as a Volunteer?
- **Flexible Schedules:** We know you've got a lot going on, so we're committed to creating volunteer schedules that accommodate your availability. You can choose to volunteer for a few hours, a day, or the entire conference – whatever works best for you.

- **Varied Roles:** We have a wide range of volunteer positions available, from registration desk assistance to session monitoring, and health and safety check-in.

- **Training and Support:** Don't worry, you won't be thrown in the deep end. As a volunteer, you'll receive comprehensive training and support to make sure you're well-equipped to handle your assigned tasks. Our experienced team will guide you every step of the way.

## Online Volunteers
What if you can’t be there in person? Don’t worry, we have volunteer opportunities online as well! We need online moderators to encourage discussion in the public chat and answer questions about the online platform as they come up.
