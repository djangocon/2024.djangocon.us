The panel will delve into how these groups contribute to diversity, inclusivity, and skill development within the Django world, emphasizing the importance of continued support and improvement for these vital communities. Attendees can expect insightful discussions on the unique contributions of each group, their role in fostering new talent, and strategies for enhancing their effectiveness in the Django landscape.
