Childcare at DjangoCon US and tech conferences more generally is an important factor that helps folks attend who otherwise may not be able to. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to DjangoCon US and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.

To assist with that, DjangoCon US will reimburse you for childcare during the conference(up to $150 per day) with a receipt. To request a reimbursement, please email hello@defna.org.

We have also collected information on a few local childcare providers:
