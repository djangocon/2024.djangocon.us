Hey Friends! We know you're looking forward to traveling into Durham next week for DjangoCon US and if you're arriving on or before the 21st we have something in store for you. Our Friends at [Black Python Devs](https://blackpythondevs.com) are happy to invite you to their First Ever LEADERSHIP SUMMIT and After Party presented by [Caktus Consulting Group, LLC](https://www.caktusgroup.com).

We'd love for you to join us for our afternoon session when our Keynote speaker Wesley Faulkner, Interactive talks from Abigagail Afi Gbadago, Tim Schilling, and Bamhare Kudzayi, and a panel featuring members of the PSF, DSF, BPD and More.
This event is focused on building leadership in the Python community at local and organizational levels.

After it's all said and done we'll head to the rooftop to mingle and chat with one another with some light drinks and snacks brought to you by our amazing friends at Caktus.

Did we mention that all of this is FREE!?
