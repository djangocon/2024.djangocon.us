We are beyond thrilled to unveil the 2024 DjangoCon US [talk and tutorial lineup](/schedule/). We'll have six tutorials on Sunday, September 22, three days of talks on September 23-25, and two days of sprints on September 26-27.

We will have three keynote speakers which will be announced over the next several weeks. Stay tuned to our [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@djangocon) and [news feed](/news/) for the announcements.

We have lots of great talks lined up, from talks about [Error Culture](/talks/error-culture/), [Troubleshooting](/talks/troubleshooting-is-a-lifestyle/), [Django: the web frameework that changed my life](/talks/django-the-web-framework-that-changed-my-life/), [Django + Alpine.js + htmx Ups & Downs](/talks/django-alpine-js-htmx-ups-downs/), [Maps with Django](/talks/maps-with-django/), [How to design and implement extensible software with plugins](/talks/how-to-design-and-implement-extensible-software-with-plugins/) [Fighting Homelessness with Django](/talks/fighting-homelessness-with-django/), and so much more!

Don't forget our awesome deep dive day, where we dig into things like [Hidden gems of Django 5.x](/talks/hidden-gems-of-django-5-x/) from new Django Fellow Sarah Boyce, [A Brief History of Django](/talks/a-brief-history-of-django/), and learning more about [Django User Model: Past, Present, and Future](/talks/django-user-model-past-present-and-future/).

We'll also have lightning talks on all three days; you will sign up for those in Durham. Details will be announced later.

As a reminder, the in person conference runs from September 22-27 at the [Durham Convention Center](/venue/).

We hope to see you in Durham! üêÇ
