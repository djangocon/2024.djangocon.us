title: 'Django: the web framework that changed my life'
track: t0
---

The year was 2018. I was studying computer science at the University of Indonesia. I learned Django as part of a web programming course. At the time, Django felt just like any other framework out there – it's part of the tech stack that you use.

A year later, I tried my luck with Django in [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc). I took a deep dive into Django's codebase to implement the cross-database `JSONField`. The feature managed to make it in Django 3.1.

Fast forward to now, I've got a job in the UK to work on the Django-powered Wagtail CMS.  Since then, I've had the opportunity to give talks at conferences in Europe and the US, including this one.

This is a story of how Django changed ~~my life~~ people's lives – and how you played a part in it.

In this talk, we'll go through:
- How Django can be used to teach web programming
- Django's participation in Google Summer of Code
- The awesome Django community and what it means for us
- What we can do to make Django change the lives of even more people
