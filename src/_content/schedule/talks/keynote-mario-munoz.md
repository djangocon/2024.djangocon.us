In the children's book "Am I Even A Bee?" by Felicity Muth, Osmia begins feeling uneasy when she notices that she doesn't look like other bees at all. She even notices that some flies, moths, or beetles look more like bees than she does. Her perspective changes when she bumps into another unlikely bee named Xyla.

Our journey as developers sometimes follows a similar pattern. We may question what it means to be a developer in the first place and we're not quite sure how we fit in. On the other end, when we grow to be more experienced, we may inadvertently (or sometimes consciously) make it more difficult for others to _belong_.

What is the role of community in an individual's sense of identity, and what are some of the ways that we try to come to terms with our place within the developer landscape? Let's find out... together!
