We are better programmers than historians or archivists.  There are a few great stories from the very early days of Django and how we managed to get it Open Sourced.   They are told in the hallways and at dinner amongst us old timers, but as Django is poised to enter its second decade it seems appropriate to record some of these stories for posterity. 

- How did the make up of the team and The World Company itself impact early Django design choices? 
- The infamous meeting where we got approval to Open Source Django
- Why the BSD license?
- Did we know what we were doing?
