In this talk, I intend to cover basic product concepts with the goal of sparking engineers' interest in how their work can have a greater impact in their users' lives. In my opinion, everyone in tech should be able to speak a little of their colleagues' language so that we can better collaborate and be more efficient as teams. With that said, I believe any engineers who would like to become more product-minded will benefit from attending as the talk covers the most common topics in that knowledge domain, serving as an introduction to the product world.
