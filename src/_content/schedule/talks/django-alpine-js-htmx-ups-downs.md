A few years ago we started to hear about the toolkits htmx and Alpine.js as a powerful combination that could  be used with Django to enable development of web applications that offer user experience akin to a single page application without the overhead of adopting a heavyweight front-end framework such as React. We were excited by the promise and adopted these tools in a few projects. In this talk we'll cover:

- The promise we saw in this tool combination
- The upside: examples of exciting wins in ways of using these tools that we recommend continuing
- The downside: some rough edges and areas of concern where we recommend caution
- Our overall assessment and plans regarding continued use of this combination
