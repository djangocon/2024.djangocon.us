This keynote will present the Django Fellowship program, highlighting its critical role in the maintenance and development of the Django project. It will cover the purpose and significance of the Fellowship, illustrating how it contributes to the project's overall success.

The talk will explore the daily tasks and responsibilities of a Django Fellow, including their priorities and key activities, with a focus on the contributing process . We will reflect on how we can make the most of the current Fellowship program, which is supported by 1.5 Fellows, and also on how the active involvement of the community is essential to Django's evolution.
