A *map* in a website is the best way to make geographic data easily accessible to users because it represents, in a simple way, the information relating to a specific geographical area and is used by many online services.

In this talk, we'll see how to create a web *map* with the **Python** based web framework **Django** using its **GeoDjango** module, storing geographic data in your local database on which to run geospatial queries.

Through this talk, you can learn how to add a *map* to your website, starting from a simple *map* based on **Spatialite/SQLite** up to a more complex and interactive *map* based on **PostGIS/PostgreSQL**.

The talk will be structured like a **hike** in the mountains, it will start gradually and then increase in **difficulty**, stopping in key **passages** and then arriving at the final **goal**.
