Did you know Django doesn't include any bug fixes or code optimisations in it's release notes? 
Each feature release (.0, .1, .2) only draws attention to a handful of features and classes many as "minor", restricting them to a very small summarising bullet point. 

If you're looking for more reasons to upgrade to the latest feature branch or are curious about hidden gems - this is the talk for you.
