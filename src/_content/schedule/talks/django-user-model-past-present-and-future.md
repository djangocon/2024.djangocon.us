Django's default User model is now 20 years old and, in the words of former Django Fellow Carlton Gibson, a "leaky battery." This talk examines the historical basis for User and past efforts to update or replace it. It evaluates current best practices, including custom user models and third-party packages, that support modern user authentication patterns. And it looks forward to future updates to User that support Django's goal of advancing the state of the art in web development.
