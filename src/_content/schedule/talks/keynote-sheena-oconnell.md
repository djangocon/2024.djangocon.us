One thing I absolutely love about the Python community is the fact that there are so many people with teacher's hearts. Teaching is an amazing thing, you can change a person's life just by spending some time with them, having conversations, showing them stuff. 

It's normal for people with software development skills to take on teaching roles - this might be through formal or informal workplace mentorship, community involvement, through being hired to teach or any number of other situations. Teaching and sharing knowledge is often a part of the job.  

Software development and teaching are two distinct skill sets. There is a science to teaching and learning - there is a robust body of knowledge, there are techniques, mindsets and patterns that make teaching effective. And, on the flip side, there are mistakes, anti-patterns and myths that are very much worth avoiding.  

It's perfectly normal for software developers to take on teaching roles and responsibilities, but it's exceedingly rare for software developers to receive any training in how to teach well. 

I've been working in alternative education for quite some time, I've learned a lot of lessons along the way. In this talk, I'll share some of the most impactful lessons I've learned.
