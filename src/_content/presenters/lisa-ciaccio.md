Starting as a musician with no technical education, Lisa began her career as a software developer through a bootcamp in 2016. Despite working in technologies across the board, from Java pipelines to React web apps (and everything in between), Rails is her domain of expertise.

While jumpstarting her own career, Lisa simultaneously built and ran an apprenticeship program for adults with no technical background; she ensured that the ladder she climbed was sturdy enough for the >100 people who came up behind her and, in the process, discovered her passion for getting historically-excluded folx into tech.

Nowadays, Lisa focuses her career on supporting tech startups with her skill and expertise.
