Jack Linke tends to learn the hard way - and shares the lessons from those experiences with others through blogging, tweets, and speaking engagements. He has been developing software and hardware projects off-and-on for most of his life, but much of his relevant web development experience has been hard-earned over the past four years during development of Watervize - a B2B2B SaaS web application (written in Django) to help irrigation water utility companies improve efficiency, analysis, and communication with staff and agriculture customers.

Jack’s technology interests include Python, the Django project, HTMX, simulation, GIS, graph theory, data storytelling, and visualization. He is a frequent contributor to the open source community and a contributing member of the Python Software Foundation.

His speaking experience includes briefing Generals on topics ranging from budgets to technical concepts, instructing at formal training centers, providing software demonstrations and feature walk-throughs, and he was certified as a Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) while serving as a Marine Corps Officer.

Outside of coding, Jack takes his Husky (Lady Duchess) on adventures, solves unusual math and logic problems, and makes a mess in the kitchen (and life).
