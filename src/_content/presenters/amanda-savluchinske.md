Amanda is a Product Manager at Vinta Software. She considers herself to be a hybrid professional, having a background in business and software engineering. Amanda enjoys getting into technical topics, having been a speaker at conferences such as DjangoCon Europe and Python Brasil in the past, but loves discussing the overlap and challenges around technical and non-technical domains. She’s a social introvert with a passion for cooking, writing, video games and (shockingly, based on her history) strength training. Her current goal is to be less chronically online and touch some grass from time to time.
