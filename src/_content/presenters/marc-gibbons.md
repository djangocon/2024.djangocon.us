Marc caught the programming bug as a child when the internet was still text-based and accessed by a 9600 baud modem.

His career path is unique; he initially studied music and played the oboe professionally with Canadian symphony orchestras before returning to his coding roots as a full-stack engineer.

Passionate about enhancing the developerâ€™s quality of life, Marc excels in testing, tooling, and automation. Beyond the technical realm, he explores ways to promote happiness, health, and connection in a remote work setting.

As a two-time cancer survivor, Marc is on a mission to help and inspire others facing adversity. He founded Port Perry Pedals, an annual cycling fundraiser in the Greater Toronto Area, raising close to $120,000 since 2021 for healthcare in his community.

Marc first appeared on the DjangoConUS stage in 2023 and has since joined the team at Lincoln Loop.
