# Presenters

Presenters can be seen on the following pages:

- `/schedule/`
- `/{talk,tutorial}/<slug>`

See `src/_includes/presenters-grid.html` for some a listing of presenters.

Presenters can be hidden by setting `hidden: true` in the front matter, though this is not advised when the schedule is active.

## Adding a new presenter

1. Copy `_PRESENTER.md.example` to a new file and name it `first-last.md` (e.g. `jane-doe.md`).
2. Fill in the details. You can remove any social networks that are unusued, leave them blank, or `null`.
3. Add the presenter's photo to the `src/_content/presenters` directory. The photo should be square (or at least portrait-shaped) and at least 600x600 pixels, in JPG or WebP format. The filename should be the same as the organizer's MD file, but with the extension `.jpg` or `.webp` (e.g. `jane-doe.jpg`). Note that presenters and organizers do not share the same photo.

## Deleting an presenter

Remove the presenters's MD file and their photo from the `src/_content/presenters` directory.
