I'm Vaarun Sinha, and I began my programming journey at the age of 12. Although I've explored various aspects of full-stack development, my heart resonates the most with Django, a framework I've passionately embraced for over 3 years. In 2021, I co-founded Digitea (a creative media tech and events company based out of Mumbai) and assumed the role of CTO. Leading a dynamic tech team, we seamlessly integrate Django into our projects, which has enabled me to learn how to use Django for any use case. I find immense joy in working with Django and am eager to continue sharing our journey and insights with the community.
