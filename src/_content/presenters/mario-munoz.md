I code Python by night, which is what happens when there's not enough time during the day. In the past couple of years, I've presented several talks/tutorials at PyCon US, DjangoCon US, Python Web Conference, North Bay Python, PyGotham, and others. Sometimes I neglect/blog on my website Python By Night, and start (or abandon) too many side projects.
