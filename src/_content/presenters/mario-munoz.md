I'm a person. Sometimes, I spend time thinking about what that means. In my past lives, I've enjoyed playing music, soccer, and the occasional video game. My career highlights include being an editor at a small non-profit, a minor stint as a pre-school teacher, managing payroll for a professional baseball team, coaching a high school soccer team, and being an analyst/project manager for HR systems. Oh, and by the time you read this, a software engineer working on Django.

I also code Python by night, which is what happens when there's not enough time during the day to poke around and break things. In the past couple of years, I've presented several talks/tutorials at PyCon US, DjangoCon US, Python Web Conference, North Bay Python, PyGotham, PyOhio, and others. Sometimes I neglect/blog on my website Python By Night, and start (or abandon) too many side projects.
