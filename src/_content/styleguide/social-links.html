title: Social links

order: 90

description: |
  Social links are used to direct users to your social media profiles. They are typically displayed in the footer of the website or with contact information for individuals.

  You can include `social-links.html` and pass in the variable `social` to render a full list of icons. Social icons are added to the page via `svg-social-icons.html`.

  Conference specific social share links are stored `conf-social-share.html` and may have some styling differences.

  Colors for social networks are defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
