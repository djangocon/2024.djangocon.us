# Places

Organziers can be seen at `/venue/#places`.

See `src/_includes/place.html` for rendering.

Places can be hidden by setting `hidden: true` in the front matter.

## Adding a new place

1. Copy `_PLACE.md.example` to a new file and name it `place-name.md` (e.g. `cool-spot.md`).
2. Fill in the details. Use quotes for strings (e.g. `"..."`) as some addresses may have breaking characters.
3. When adding a map link, use the "Share" link from Google Maps. The URL should look like `https://goo.gl/maps/...`.
4. Add the place's photo to the `src/_content/places` directory. The photo should be square (or at least portrait-shaped) and at least 400x400 pixels, in JPG or WebP format. The filename should be the same as the place's MD file, but with the extension `.jpg` or `.webp` (e.g. `cool-spot.jpg`).

## Deleting an organizer

Remove the place's MD file and respective photo from the `src/_content/places` directory.
