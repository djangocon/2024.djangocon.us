Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary database. Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster, with options for replication and high availability. Valkey natively supports a rich collection of datatypes, including strings, numbers, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and more. You can operate on data structures in-place with an expressive collection of commands. Valkey also supports native extensibility with built-in scripting support for Lua and supports module plugins to create new commands, data types, and more.
