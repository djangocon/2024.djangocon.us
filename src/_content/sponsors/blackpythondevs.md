Black Python Devs seeks to extend the ecosystem of Python Communities to Black and Colo(u)red Communities around the world. Our goal is to become the largest community of Black Python Developers in the world and establish our community as a source for diverse leaders in the greater Python community. 

We aim to:

* Establish guidance, mentorship, and career support for Black Pythonistas around the world.
* Create opportunities for the Python community to invest in local communities of Black Python Devs members.
* Increase participation of Black Python Devs members in existing Python community programs, events, and initiatives.
