<p>Hello, I'm Sarah Boyce ðŸ‘‹<br>
I've been working as a Django Fellow since April 2024 having previously been on Django's Review and Triage team. I'm also a co-founder of Djangonaut Space - a mentorship program developing contributors to Django and beyond.<br>
I love badminton, drawing/painting people, laughing and (unsurprisingly) Django and it's community.</p>
