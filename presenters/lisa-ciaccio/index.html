<p>Starting as a musician with no technical education, Lisa began her career as a software developer through a bootcamp in 2016. Despite working in technologies across the board, from Java pipelines to React web apps (and everything in between), Rails is her domain of expertise.</p>
<p>While jumpstarting her own career, Lisa simultaneously built and ran an apprenticeship program for adults with no technical background; she ensured that the ladder she climbed was sturdy enough for the &gt;100 people who came up behind her and, in the process, discovered her passion for getting historically-excluded folx into tech.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Lisa focuses her career on supporting tech startups with her skill and expertise.</p>
