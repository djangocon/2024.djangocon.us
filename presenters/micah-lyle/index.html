<p>I'm a software architect and engineer, and co-run a design and software agency and consultancy called Elyon Technologies. Before that, I spent several years as a solo freelancer, working on a number of different projects and systems. Almost everything I did I built in Django (from scratch or on top of something existing), and I strongly focused on a niche specifically working on Django apps both through UpWork and also word of mouth referrals. I've gotten to build and architect software systems with Django across a number of different verticals which has provided both narrow/focused perspectives in the Django space but also helped me grow opinions on how codebases should be structured in the long run.</p>
