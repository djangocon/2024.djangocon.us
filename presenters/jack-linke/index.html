<p>Jack Linke tends to learn the hard way - and shares the lessons from those experiences with others through blogging, tweets, and speaking engagements. He has been developing software and hardware projects off-and-on for most of his life, but much of his relevant web development experience has been hard-earned over the past four years during development of Watervize - a B2B2B SaaS web application (written in Django) to help irrigation water utility companies improve efficiency, analysis, and communication with staff and agriculture customers.</p>
<p>Jackâ€™s technology interests include Python, the Django project, HTMX, simulation, GIS, graph theory, data storytelling, and visualization. He is a frequent contributor to the open source community and a contributing member of the Python Software Foundation.</p>
<p>His speaking experience includes briefing Generals on topics ranging from budgets to technical concepts, instructing at formal training centers, providing software demonstrations and feature walk-throughs, and he was certified as a Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) while serving as a Marine Corps Officer.</p>
<p>Outside of coding, Jack takes his Husky (Lady Duchess) on adventures, solves unusual math and logic problems, and makes a mess in the kitchen (and life).</p>
