<p>Back in 2019, I participated in Google Summer of Code with Django, during which I implemented the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#jsonfield">cross-database <code>JSONField</code></a> that became available in Django 3.1. Now, I work as a Developer at Torchbox, building new features and improvements to the Django-based <a href="https://wagtail.org">Wagtail CMS</a> and its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Outside of the Django world, I maintain my project <a href="https://giscus.app">giscus</a>, a comment system powered by GitHub Discussions. You can find me @laymonage on <a href="https://github.com/laymonage">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@laymonage">Fosstodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/laymonage">Twitter</a>, and other sites.</p>
