<p>I am a software developer with more than 40 years of professional experience across more platforms, languages and operating systems than I care to count.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm a member of the Baltimore-based Digital Services group within WSP, working in the Traffic Engineering field on projects involving Connected Vehicles and Smart Infrastructure / Smart Intersection projects. Django is our &quot;go-to&quot; tool for building configuration and testing suites for systems being embedded within traffic intersections.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am a moderator on the Django Forum web site, and I try to answer questions there as well.</p>
<p>When you aren't seeing me working with Django or on the forum, you'll likely find me at a table playing board games.</p>
