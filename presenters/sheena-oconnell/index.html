<p>I’ve been programming in some form since my early teens. After high school, I went on to get an Honors degree in electrical engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. I’ve always been drawn to software development and to teaching. I worked for a string of startups and gained a lot of experience in all aspects of software development, from requirements gathering and UX design to implementation, deployment, and monitoring.</p>
<p>I am currently the CTO of Umuzi. Our purpose is to reduce social inequality in Africa through digital education. Through my work at Umuzi, I have been able to dive into my multiple passions and develop a lot of skills at the intersection of tech and education.</p>
